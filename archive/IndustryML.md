# ML in Industry vs. Kaggle: Key Tasks & Differences

### a. Key Differences: Kaggle vs. Real-World ML

| Kaggle Competitions                 | Real-World ML Work               |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Focus on single metric (e.g., RMSE) | Multiple, often competing KPIs   |
| Leaderboard-driven optimization     | Business value & risk trade-offs |
| No deployment required              | End-to-end deployment essential  |
| Static datasets                     | Streaming/live data, changing distributions |
| No cost/latency constraints         | Must optimize for resources      |
| No regulatory constraints           | Legal, privacy, compliance issues|
| Little/no stakeholder interaction   | Frequent cross-team collaboration|
| Short-term, one-off solutions       | Long-term, maintainable systems  |


**Summary:**
- **Real-world ML vs. Competition Settings:**
  - Real-world ML is a team sport, requiring collaboration across engineering, product, legal, and business.
  - Success is measured not just by model scores, but by business impact, reliability, and maintainability over time.
  - Kaggle is excellent for honing modeling, feature engineering, and validation skills.

- **Effort Distribution:**
  - The bulk of effort is spent outside of pure modeling—data, deployment, monitoring, and communication are equally (if not more) important for success.

- **Skills for Success:**
  - Winning in industry requires broader skills: problem framing, data engineering, deployment, monitoring, and communication.
  - To bridge the gap, seek real-world projects, contribute to open-source, or shadow ML teams in production environments.

### b. Key ML Tasks in Industry Not Taught by Kaggle

Real-world machine learning is a complex, collaborative, and iterative process that differs fundamentally from the Kaggle competition environment. Below, each task is analyzed from multiple angles: impact on scores and improvements, required effort, modeling implications, and the end-to-end process.

- **Problem Scoping & Framing:**
  - *Description:* Translating ambiguous business needs into actionable ML tasks.
  - *Impact:* The quality of scoping often determines the ceiling for achievable model performance—solving the wrong problem, or optimizing for the wrong metric, leads to wasted effort regardless of model quality.
  - *Effort Level:* High - requires extensive stakeholder interviews, domain research, and iterative refinement.
  - *Modeling Implications:* The chosen framing (classification vs. regression, time horizon, granularity) has a profound effect on data, features, and evaluation metrics.
  - *Process:* Iterative and ongoing—often revisited as new data or feedback emerges.

- **Data Acquisition & Engineering:**
  - *Description:* Gathering, cleaning, and integrating data from multiple, often messy sources.
  - *Impact:* Data quality is the single biggest determinant of real-world model success. Improvements here often yield larger gains than model tweaks.
  - *Effort Level:* High - often the most time-consuming phase of the project.
  - *Modeling Implications:* Enables richer feature sets, reduces noise, and supports more robust validation. Poor data pipelines lead to unreliable or non-reproducible results.
  - *Process:* End-to-end pipelines must be automated, versioned, and monitored for changes.

- **Model Specification:**
  - *Description:* Defining the requirements, constraints, and expectations for a machine learning solution.
  - *Impact:* Critical for ensuring alignment with organizational goals, technical constraints, and regulatory requirements.
  - *Effort Level:* Medium - requires careful coordination but is typically less time-consuming than data engineering.
  - *Modeling Implications:* Guides the development of a well-scoped model that meets business objectives and technical constraints.
  - *Process:* Involves creating a detailed document that outlines the business objective, data sources, feature definitions, model architecture, evaluation metrics, deployment targets, resource constraints, security and compliance requirements, monitoring and retraining triggers, and rollback and failover procedures.

  - *Impact:* Non-compliance can halt projects or result in legal penalties, regardless of model accuracy.
  - *Effort Level:* High - requires coordination with multiple teams and compliance with regulations.
  - *Modeling Implications:* May restrict feature use, require anonymization, or limit data retention. Sometimes necessitates explainable models.
  - *Process:* Ongoing, with regular audits and documentation.

- **Model Deployment & Serving:**
  - *Description:* Delivering models as APIs, batch jobs, or embedded systems.

  - *Modeling Implications:* May require converting models to efficient formats, reducing latency, or supporting rollback.
  - *Process:* Includes CI/CD, containerization, and robust monitoring.

- **Monitoring & Maintenance:**
  - *Description:* Tracking model/data drift, performance, and system health in production.
  - *Impact:* Ongoing monitoring is essential to catch silent failures, drift, or data quality issues before they impact business outcomes.
  - *Effort Level:* Medium - requires initial setup but becomes more automated over time.

  - *Effort Level:* Continuous - requires regular updates and presentations to various stakeholders.
  - *Modeling Implications:* May drive the choice of interpretable models or require visualizations.
  - *Process:* Ongoing, with presentations, reports, and dashboards.

- **Cost & Latency Constraints:**
  - *Description:* Optimizing for inference speed, memory, and hardware costs.
  - *Impact:* Directly affects user experience and operational expenses. Sometimes, a "worse" model is chosen because it is faster or cheaper.
  - *Effort Level:* Variable - depends on the specific performance requirements and constraints.
  - *Modeling Implications:* May need model quantization, distillation, or pruning.
  - *Process:* Often iterative, with trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.

- **A/B Testing & Experimentation:**
  - *Description:* Validating model impact via controlled experiments.
  - *Impact:* The only way to prove real-world business value. Offline metrics often fail to predict live performance.
  - *Effort Level:* High - requires careful experimental design and analysis.
  - *Modeling Implications:* May require special logging, experiment tracking, and analysis pipelines.
  - *Process:* Includes experiment design, execution, analysis, and rollout/rollback decisions.

- **Incident Response & Debugging:**
  - *Description:* Diagnosing and fixing failures in live systems.
  - *Impact:* Critical for reliability and trust. Poor incident response can cause major business disruptions.
  - *Effort Level:* Variable - can be high during incidents but typically lower during normal operations.
  - *Modeling Implications:* May require building tools for explainability and traceability.
  - *Process:* Includes incident playbooks, postmortems, and continuous improvement.
